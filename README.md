# TW5 TableTool

Here are some TW5 customization I am working on to make it easier to create and modify tables built upon the content of other tiddlers. This work is not complete and not ready to be cloned and used as is. 

As well, browsing the wiki, you can find something useful or maybe you can give me suggestions to improve it. In both the cases you are welcome.

The wiki URL is: http://mauloop.github.io/tw5-table-tool
The GitHub repository is: https://github.com/mauloop/tw5-table-tool

It is originally cloned from [the precious work of danielo515](https://github.com/danielo515/TW5-auto-publish2gh-pages). Everything related to hosting TW5 on GitHub and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) integration is well explained there.

If you are interested in TW5 itself, go to the [Tiddlywiki home page](http://tiddlywiki.com/).
