# TW5 TableTool

Here are some TW5 customization I am working on to make it easier to create and modify tables built upon the content of other tiddlers. 

The wiki URL is: http://mauloop.github.io/tw5-table-tool
The GitHub repository is: https://github.com/mauloop/tw5-table-tool

This site is built as a Github page, thanks to [the precious work of danielo515](https://github.com/danielo515/TW5-auto-publish2gh-pages). Everything related to hosting TW5 on GitHub and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) integration is well explained there.

If you are interested in TW5 itself, go to the [Tiddlywiki home page](http://tiddlywiki.com/).
